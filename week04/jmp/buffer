Two of the bits in the FLAGS register that these instructions set are the overflow and carry flag. The overflow flag is set if the true result of the operation is too big to fit into the destination for signed arithmetic. The carry flag is set if there is a carry in the msb of an addition or a borrow in the msb of a subtraction. Thus, it can be used to detect overflow for unsigned arithmetic.
